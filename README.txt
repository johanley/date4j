Date4j is a lightweight replacement for Java's built-in date classes.

 - compiles with JDK 1.5 or greater
 - can be used in Android projects
 - its public API is essentially a single class (DateTime)
 - BSD License

In 2014, improved date classes were finally added to the JDK.
Those classes render date4j more or less obsolete. 

There's still a use case in which date4j is a good resource.
When new languages are created, they all need a way to represent dates and times.
As a starting point, one option is to port date4j to the new language.
Since date4j consists essentially of a single class, this will not be
be an excessively onerous task.
